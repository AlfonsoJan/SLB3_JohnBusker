> EV Biotech is a biotechnology company that leverages synthetic biology and genetic engineering to develop sustainable production methods for high-value chemicals, such as flavors, fragrances, and cosmetics. The company's proprietary platform technology allows for the engineering of microorganisms, such as bacteria and yeast, to produce target compounds in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner. This approach enables the replacement of traditional chemical production methods, which are often energy-intensive and rely on non-renewable resources.

> I spoke to the company at the Hanze meet and greet. They are very nice people. And it seems like a very nice company to work for with nice colleagues. Only the work itself doesn't seem fun to me. Doing research / creating pipelines. That is why I did not choose this company.

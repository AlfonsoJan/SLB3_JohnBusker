#### Reflectie Thesis Defence
> Diltion talked about his research during his phd defence. It was about retrieving data from the cloud and eventually making it human-readable again. Using dashboard. And using ML to determine protein ratio.
> 
> The first part was all a bit strange for me. Since I know nothing about the cloud, but I found it interesting to work with this myself.
> 
>Then came a bit about ML, which I found interesting. But then I thought to myself, why did he do this. Because for a carton of milk you have to go to the lab to determine the protein level so you can put the nutritional value sticker on the product. So this was all a bit for nothing for my liking.

### Beroep

> As a bioinformaticist, I can see myself doing this. Since the cloud part, more of the data processing and making it readable.

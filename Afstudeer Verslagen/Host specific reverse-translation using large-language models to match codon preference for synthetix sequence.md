#### Reflectie Thesis Defence
> Reindert talked about his research during his phd defence. It was about reverse-translation using large-language model. Lets say you have proline and you want to translate this to DNA. You have 4 options CCU, CCC, CCA and CCG. Which one should you pick?
> 
> The part about large-language models was challenging to understand and confusing. Because he was more about talking about large-language models using with real, grammatical correct sentences. And not proteins/sequences.
> 
>I found the presentation a bit chaotic. And at the end, we found out that there is probably an error in his model. And there was a little piece on deep learning that I thought was really interesting. Since I am also going to do this for my internship.

### Beroep

> As a bioinformatician, I can do this as a profession, but it doesn't seem fun to do and boring.
